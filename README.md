## 📜 Mission Briefing

Greetings, Digital Archaeologist!

You have been selected for a top-secret mission. Our team has discovered fragments of **Atlantis** - a legendary advanced system thought to be lost forever. The city's digital infrastructure has been scattered across multiple dimensions (branches), sealed in ancient containers (Docker), and protected by complex Linux-based security systems.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to:

1. 🔍 Navigate the excavation site and uncover hidden clues
2. 🧩 Locate and merge the scattered fragments of Atlantis
3. 🏗️ Rebuild the ancient containers that power the city
4. ⚡ Bring Atlantis back to life!

**WARNING**: Each phase must be completed in order. Attempting to skip ahead will result in mission failure.
