# 🏺 Phase 1: The Excavation Site

Welcome to the dig site, Archaeologist!

The entrance to Atlantis is protected by ancient puzzles. You must prove your mastery of the Linux command line to proceed.

---

## 🎯 Mission Objectives

### Task 1: Explore the Temple Entrance
Navigate to the `temple-entrance/` directory and discover what secrets it holds.

**Commands you'll need:**
- `cd` - change directory
- `ls` - list contents
- `cat` - read file contents
- `ls -la` - list all files including hidden ones

**Hint**: Not everything is visible at first glance. The ancients were masters of hiding things in plain sight.

---

### Task 2: Decode the Ancient Message
Inside the temple, you'll find encrypted messages. Use your Linux skills to decode them.

**Commands you'll need:**
- `grep` - search for patterns
- `echo` - display text
- `base64 -d` - decode base64 (if needed)

---

### Task 3: Unlock the Sealed Chamber
The sealed chamber requires specific permissions to open. You must set the correct permissions to proceed.

**Commands you'll need:**
- `chmod` - change file permissions
- `./` - execute a file

---

## ✅ Completion Criteria

When you successfully complete all tasks, you will receive **THE FRAGMENT MAP** - a crucial artifact that reveals the location of the scattered Atlantis fragments in the Git repository.

---

**Status**: 🔴 LOCKED  
**Next Phase**: Fragment Hunt (Git) - LOCKED until Phase 1 complete

---

### 🆘 Need Help?

If you're stuck, remember:
- Use `ls -la` to see EVERYTHING in a directory
- Use `cat filename` to read file contents
- Use `grep "pattern" filename` to search within files
- File permissions: `r`(read)=4, `w`(write)=2, `x`(execute)=1

Good luck, Archaeologist!
