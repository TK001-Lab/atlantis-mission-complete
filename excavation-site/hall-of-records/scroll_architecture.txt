📜 SCROLL OF THE ARCHITECTURE

The great city rose from land so fair,
With towers reaching through the air.
ZEUS had blessed the founding day,
When Atlantis first saw light of day.

Columns tall and arches wide,
Built with craftsmanship and pride.
The architects of ancient lore,
Created wonders to explore.
